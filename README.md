# 🎵 Open Beats  

Open Beats is a simple music player I built while learning web development.  

## 📚 What I Learned  
- Handling audio with JavaScript (`<audio>` element, play/pause, load events)  
- DOM manipulation & event listeners  
- Using **async/await** to fetch data from APIs  
- Structuring a project and planning new features  

## 🛠️ What I Used  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for UI & functionality  
- Native **HTML5 Audio API** for music control  
- **API fetching** to explore dynamic data handling  

## 🔜 What’s Coming Next  
- Playlist support  
- Search functionality  
- Seekbar to control playback progress  

This project is part of my journey to understand how real-world music apps like Spotify work under the hood. 🚀
